# Git 101
<!-- notes for my editing this lesson
two things this lesson should do,
1. provide a high level overview of git and why its used
2. explain the basic work flow of staging, commiting and pushing

Make sure to get the point across that git can feel cumbersome and unintuitive at the start, to not worry about understanding everything about git. The students will get more comfortable with it as they use it, git is a passive skill that will improve over time with use and understanding the basics is enough for now. They will learn more of the advanced features of git as and when they need them.

Git is an essential skill for a modern web developer, in this lesson we will have a look at what git is, why its needed and the basics of how it works.

the reason we are introducing git now before we have git into coding is for a few reasons.
1. the sooner the student understands the basics, the sooner they will get comfortable with git
2. they will be able to upload the coming projects to github with at least a basic understanding of what they are doing
3. having your projects on github will allow them to get help easier from others, as they can just share a link to their repo to share their code when they need help
4. start building a git profile.

## What is Git and why is it important:
In this section we will include a high level overview of what git is and why its important to know, one or two good resources about what git is used for should cover the second point.

## The Basics of how git works
In this section we will describe the basics of adding git to a project and the basic work flow of staging and committing files as well as pushing them to a remote. A small exercise can be added here to too. One of the assignments should be codeschools try git.
